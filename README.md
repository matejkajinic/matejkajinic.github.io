# Matej Kajinic

I’m an engineer-investor who pairs hands-on tech work with market analysis to make a few high-conviction, concentrated long-term bets on outliers.

My work is driven by a core thesis: the world’s two most valuable currencies are FLOPS (Intelligence) and Watts (Energy). 

I have an M.S. in Computer Science, where I researched using neural networks to forecast financial market trends. I also have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering & Communication Technologies, focused on electromagnetic waves and real-world propagation models.


## Research and writing

I study real world and physical limits of tech progress.

* **[The Manifestos](https://github.com/matejkajinic/the-manifestos)** - list inspired by conversation between David Perell and Marc Andreessen, Marc concluded: *'It's amazing there aren't more manifestos'*.


## Things I like to do in free time
Lift heavy, swim long, walk far, eat a lot, read more, watch tv shows and movies often.
